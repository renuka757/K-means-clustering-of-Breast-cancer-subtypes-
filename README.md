# K-means-clustering-of-Breast-cancer-subtypes-
Analyzed breast cancer RNA-seq data with PAM50 subtypes (LumA, LumB, HER2, Basal, Normal). Processed VST-normalized counts, selected 2,000 high-variance genes, performed PCA, and used the PCA coordinates for K-means clustering to identify subtype-specific patterns.
